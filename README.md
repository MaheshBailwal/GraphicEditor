# Paint-Brush

This code was done when I was studying computers graphics in school. I have done paint brush short of application using turbo c compiler on 16 bit windows OS. This application is basically build upon some computer graphics algorithms (mentioned below) which I implemented in c. 

* Bresenham's line 
* Bresenham's circle/ellipse drawing algorithm
* Bezier curve
* B-spline
* 3D rotation on x,y and z axis
* Flood fill
* Clipping algorithm
